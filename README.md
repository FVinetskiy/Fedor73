<h4 align="center">if we talk about professional achievements, back in 2017 I worked as a rescuer, and already in 2020 I was a front-end developer at Mediasoft. I taught myself and was able to succeed in a completely different area. I consider this achievement significant. If you take the work out of brackets, then I consider the rescue of the cat Vasily a reason for pride.<br> By the way, I live now :)</h4>
